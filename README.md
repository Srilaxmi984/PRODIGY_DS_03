## Task 03: Decision Tree Classification


#### 📌 Description


For this task, I was assigned to build and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier to predict outcomes using a banking dataset. The objective was to preprocess the dataset, train a machine learning model, and analyze its performance.


#### 📊 Dataset


Sample Dataset: I used the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about bank customers and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.


#### 🔍 Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values in the dataset.

Applied Label Encoding to categorical columns (e.g., job, education, housing).

Defined the target variable "y" and converted it into a binary format (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.


#### 📈 Model Training & Evaluation


Used DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn to train the model.

Made predictions on the test dataset.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and classification report.

#### 🌳 Decision Tree Visualization


Plotted the trained Decision Tree using plot_tree() from sklearn.tree.

Visualized the decision-making process of the model.


#### ⚡ Output


The trained Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of (accuracy_score from output) on the test dataset.

The visualization helped understand how different features influenced predictions.


#### 🚀 Impact


This task provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and visualization using real-world banking data.
